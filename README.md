|I_i| ≤ I_max,i  ∀i
P_total = Σᵢ Iᵢ²Rᵢ ≤ P_max
```

#### Field Steering Constraint
At target position r_target:
```
|B⃗(r_target) - B⃗_desired| ≤ ε
```

### Appendix C: Frequency Multiplexing Theory

#### Orthogonal Frequency Channels
For N channels with frequencies ωᵢ:
```
∫₋ᵀ/²ᵀ/² e^(i(ωᵢ - ωⱼ)t) dt = T δᵢⱼ  (as T → ∞)
```

#### Guard Band Calculation
Minimum frequency separation:
```
Δω_min = 2π × (BW_signal + BW_guard)
```

Where BWguard ≥ 0.2 × BWsignal for adequate isolation.

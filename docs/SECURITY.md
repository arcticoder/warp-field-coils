# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

The Enhanced LQG Closed-Loop Field Control System maintains security support for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.0.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.0   | :x:                |

## Safety-Critical Security Considerations

This system manipulates spacetime geometry and requires the highest levels of security due to potential physical consequences of unauthorized access or malicious manipulation.

### Critical Security Areas

1. **Field Control Access**: Unauthorized access to field control systems could result in spacetime distortions
2. **Safety Protocol Bypass**: Circumventing medical-grade safety systems poses severe risks
3. **Causality Violations**: Malicious manipulation could potentially create temporal paradoxes
4. **Electromagnetic Interference**: Unauthorized field generation could disrupt critical systems

### Security Requirements

- **Authentication**: Multi-factor authentication required for all control interfaces
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control with medical-grade oversight
- **Audit Logging**: Complete audit trail of all field control operations
- **Encryption**: All control communications must use AES-256 encryption
- **Network Security**: Air-gapped operation recommended for safety-critical deployments

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

**CRITICAL**: Security vulnerabilities in this system could have physical consequences. Please report responsibly.

### Immediate Response Required

If you discover a vulnerability that could:
- Bypass safety protocols
- Enable unauthorized field generation
- Compromise causality preservation
- Affect medical-grade safety systems

**DO NOT** create a public issue. Instead:

1. **Email**: Send details to security@warp-field-coils.dev (if available)
2. **Encryption**: Use PGP encryption for sensitive details
3. **Severity Assessment**: Indicate potential physical consequences
4. **Proof of Concept**: Include PoC only if safe to do so

### Standard Vulnerabilities

For standard software vulnerabilities without immediate physical risk:

1. Create a security advisory through GitHub's security tab
2. Provide detailed description and reproduction steps
3. Include potential impact assessment
4. Suggest mitigation strategies if known

### Response Timeline

- **Critical Safety Issues**: Immediate response (< 1 hour)
- **High Severity**: Response within 24 hours
- **Medium Severity**: Response within 1 week
- **Low Severity**: Response within 2 weeks

### Vulnerability Assessment Criteria

#### Critical (Immediate Response)
- Bypass of positive energy constraints (T_μν ≥ 0)
- Causality preservation failures
- Medical safety protocol compromise
- Emergency shutdown bypass

#### High (24 Hour Response)
- Unauthorized field control access
- Authentication/authorization bypass
- Control system manipulation
- Safety margin reductions

#### Medium (1 Week Response)
- Information disclosure
- Performance degradation attacks
- Non-safety-critical control access
- Monitoring system bypass

#### Low (2 Week Response)
- Documentation vulnerabilities
- Non-critical information leaks
- Performance optimization bypasses
- Non-essential feature access

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers
- Never commit authentication credentials
- Validate all field control inputs
- Implement fail-safe defaults
- Maintain safety protocol integrity
- Use secure coding practices
- Regular security audits

### For Operators
- Regular security updates
- Monitor audit logs continuously
- Implement network security controls
- Maintain physical security of control systems
- Regular backup of safety configurations
- Emergency response procedures

### For Researchers
- Isolated test environments only
- Never bypass safety protocols in research
- Document all security implications
- Peer review for safety-critical changes
- Responsible disclosure of findings

## Incident Response

### Safety-Critical Incidents
1. **Immediate**: Activate emergency shutdown protocols
2. **Isolation**: Disconnect from all networks
3. **Assessment**: Evaluate physical safety implications
4. **Notification**: Alert all stakeholders immediately
5. **Investigation**: Conduct thorough security forensics
6. **Remediation**: Implement fixes with safety validation

### Standard Security Incidents
1. **Containment**: Limit scope of compromise
2. **Assessment**: Evaluate impact and risks
3. **Investigation**: Determine root cause
4. **Remediation**: Implement and test fixes
5. **Communication**: Notify affected parties
6. **Prevention**: Update security measures

# VS Code Insiders Restart Troubleshooting

## Issue Description
VS Code Insiders is restarting when GitHub Copilot processes complex responses, causing loss of context and showing only "Retry" button.

## Potential Causes Identified

1. **Memory Pressure**: One VS Code process showed negative memory values indicating overflow
2. **Extension Conflicts**: Multiple VS Code processes running simultaneously 
3. **File System Operations**: Large number of file read/write operations
4. **Python Execution Load**: Complex import chains and module loading

## Mitigation Strategies

### 1. Reduce Tool Usage Volume
- Limit parallel tool calls
- Use smaller, focused operations
- Avoid reading large files in chunks

### 2. Memory Management
- Clear intermediate variables
- Use generators instead of large lists
- Implement garbage collection hints

### 3. VS Code Configuration
- Disable auto-save during operations
- Reduce extension load
- Increase memory limits if possible

### 4. Workaround Approaches
- Break complex operations into smaller steps
- Use external script execution instead of inline tools
- Implement checkpointing for recovery

## Immediate Actions
1. Keep responses shorter and focused
2. Minimize file system operations
3. Use background processes for heavy operations
4. Implement error recovery mechanisms

## Test Results
- Basic Python operations: ✓ PASS
- NumPy/Matplotlib imports: ✓ PASS 
- File operations: ✓ PASS
- Large data structures: ✓ PASS

Issue appears to be related to cumulative load rather than specific operations.

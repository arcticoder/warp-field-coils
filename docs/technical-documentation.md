## Mathematical Framework

### Enhanced Inertial Damper Field (IDF)
The Enhanced IDF system implements three-component acceleration control:

```
a_IDF = a_base + a_curvature + a_backreaction
```

Where:
- **Base inertial compensation**: `a_base = -(||j||/j_max) * j`
- **Curvature coupling**: `a_curvature = λ_c * R * j`
- **Backreaction damping**: `a_backreaction = -(α_max/ρ_eff) * ||j||² * û`

### Enhanced Structural Integrity Field (SIF)
The Enhanced SIF system provides three-component stress compensation:

```
σ_SIF = σ_base + σ_ricci + σ_LQG
```

Where:
- **Base material stress**: `σ_base = μ * C_ij`
- **Ricci coupling**: `σ_ricci = α_R * R * δ_ij`
- **LQG corrections**: `σ_LQG = α_LQG * f_polymer(C_ij, R)`

### Stress-Energy Tensor Integration
Direct coupling with Einstein field equations through jerk-based stress-energy tensor:

```
T^jerk_μν = [[½ρ_eff||j||², ρ_eff j^T], [ρ_eff j, -½ρ_eff||j||² I_3]]
```

### Medical-Grade Safety Framework
Comprehensive safety enforcement with real-time monitoring:

```
||a|| ≤ 5 m/s², ||σ_ij||_F ≤ 1 × 10⁻⁶ N/m²
```

## Implementation Details

### Enhanced Control System Architecture
The enhanced control systems are implemented with medical-grade safety and real-time performance:

    """Enhanced control loop with IDF and SIF integration"""
    idf_acceleration = compute_idf_response(state)
    sif_compensation = compute_sif_response(state)
    safety_status = enforce_medical_safety(idf_acceleration, sif_compensation)
    return integrate_enhanced_systems(idf_acceleration, sif_compensation, safety_status)
```

    """Integration step for enhanced control systems"""
    idf_system = EnhancedInertialDamper(config)
    sif_system = EnhancedStructuralIntegrity(config)
    
    # Initialize enhanced systems
    idf_system.initialize(results['exotic_matter'])
    sif_system.initialize(results['field_geometry'])
    
    # Execute enhanced control
    idf_result = idf_system.execute_control_cycle()
    sif_result = sif_system.execute_control_cycle()
    
    return combine_enhanced_results(idf_result, sif_result)
